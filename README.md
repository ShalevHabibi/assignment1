Ex1 Project
This is a project that deals with number conversions between different bases and checks if a number is valid in a specific base.

Features
Convert Numbers: Convert numbers between different bases (e.g., from binary to decimal or hexadecimal).
Check Number Validity: Check if a number is valid in a specific base (e.g., check if "1011" is valid in base 2).
Max Index Function: Find the number with the highest value from a list of numbers in different bases.
Equality Check: Check if two numbers are equal after converting them to the same base.
Functions
number2Int(String number): Converts a number (in string format) to an integer.
int2Number(int number, int base): Converts an integer to a number in the specified base.
isNumber(String number): Checks if a number is valid in a given base.
maxIndex(String[] numbers): Finds the index of the number with the highest value from a list of numbers.
equals(String num1, String num2): Checks if two numbers are equal.
Tests
The project includes tests for each function to ensure it works correctly. These tests check if the conversion functions handle different cases, like converting to binary, hexadecimal, and checking if the numbers are valid.
